      <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
     Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
     when an unknown printer took a galley of <span class="cupcake">type</span> and <span class="cupcake">scrambled</span> it to make a type
     specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
     electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
     the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
     and more recently with desktop publishing software like <span class="cupcake">Aldus PageMaker</span>
     including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
